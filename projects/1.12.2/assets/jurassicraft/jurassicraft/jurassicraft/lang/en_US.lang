info.jurassicraft.triceratops.name=Triceratops horridus lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous. They were herbivorous, eating mainly palms, cycads and ferns. When fully grown, Triceratops measured 8-9 m long and weighed 6-12 tons. The head frill was used for display, while the horns were used for attack and defence. Triceratops lives in family groups of 5 - 15 individuals led by an adult female matriarch.
info.jurassicraft.dilophosaurus.name=At 6-7 metres long, this Early Jurassic theropod from Arizona was one of the first large predatory dinosaurs. It had twin crests on its head that may have been for sexual display. Dilophosaurus venenifer is actually venomous, preferring to spit venom into its prey's eyes. If the venom hits the eyes, it causes blindness, agonizing pain, and eventually paralysis. Dilophosaurus lives in small, disorganized gangs (around 3 - 10 individuals) of both males and females.
info.jurassicraft.dryosaurus.name=Dryosaurus altus was a small, skittish ornithopod from the Late Jurassic period in North America. With long legs and a slender build, It's a terrifically agile creature. Always on the lookout for predators, Dryosaurus is able to outmaneuver most threats posed to it. Despite being an herbivore, it possessed a mouth full of self-sharpening teeth, making it highly effective at shrubbery decimation.
info.jurassicraft.brachiosaurus.name=Brachiosaurus altithorax was a giant sauropod that lived in North America. It can grow up to 25 or 26 metres long and 9 metres or more in height, and can weigh up to 40 tons. It is thought to have browsed from the tops of trees, eating mostly ginkgo leaves, conifers, tree-ferns, and large cycads. Brachiosaurs live in herds of 2 - 15 individuals, led by an alpha male or female. They produce trumpeting "singing" calls to communicate with one another.
info.jurassicraft.parasaurolophus.name=Parasaurolophus walkeri was a hadrosaur that lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous. It measured 10 m long, and weighed about 2.5 tons. Its large, curved, tubular crest on its head was hollow, was used to produce sound. Parasaurolophus was a herbivore, and like other hadrosaurs, it used cheek teeth to grind its food. Parasaurolophus lives in herds of about 5 - 50 animals, a mix of males and females. Parasaur calls can travel for miles, and they are very loud.
info.jurassicraft.tyrannosaurus.name=Tyrannosaurus rex was a huge theropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous in North America. It grew about 12-13 metres long, and 6 tons in weight. Healed bite wounds from T. rex found on herbivore bones suggest that it was indeed a predator. However, it also scavenged. They led a violent lifestyle, and were fiercely territorial. T. rex is magnificent, but is not to be taken lightly!
info.jurassicraft.velociraptor.name=Velociraptor nublarensis was a small theropod dinosaur that lived in East Asia during the Late Cretaceous. An opportunist, it hunted a wide variety of prey ranging from small mammals and lizards, to medium-sized dinosaurs. Quick, highly intelligent, and highly aggressive, Velociraptor is very hard to keep. They accomplished escape artists, and have a good memory. They rival a cheetah's speed, and can leap up to 4 metres vertically.
info.jurassicraft.deinonychus.name=Deinonychus is a genus of dromaeosaurid dinosaur that originated from Early Cretaceous North America. A close relative of Velociraptor and one of the best-known dromaeosaurid species, the Deinonychus can be distinguished by their head crest and distinctive coloration.
info.jurassicraft.gallimimus.name=Gallimimus bullatus was a herbivorous theropod that lived in Mongolia during the Late Cretaceous. It measured 6 - 8 m when fully grown. It preferred to live near water, grazing on vegetation and sifting algae. Gallimimus was a fast runner, although its top speed is currently unknown. Gallis are herding animals that live in flocks of 10 - 100 individuals, usually a mix of males and females. They are extremely panicky, and any potential threat can cause a stampede.
info.jurassicraft.microraptor.name=One of the most famous feathered dinosaurs ever found, Microraptor zhaoianus lived in northeast China during the Early Cretaceous. Microraptor's feathers are known to have been iridescent black. Microraptor is an intelligent pack-hunting predator that eats insects and other small animals.
info.jurassicraft.coelacanth.name=Coelacanths are the last modern Coelocanthiform fish, an order dating back to the Devonian. The word "coelacanth" means "hollow spine". Using 8 different fins, the coelacanth can easily turn in almost any direction. Coelacanths are nocturnal, piscivorous drift-hunters found only in the depths of the Indian Ocean. Prehistoric coelacanths however were hugely diverse. Coelacanths are oviviviparous.
info.jurassicraft.mussaurus.name=Mussaurus patagonicus is a small prosauropod dinosaur from Triassic Argentina. Its name means "mouse lizard", as for a long time it was known only from tiny baby skeletons. The proportions of the babies suggest the adults cared for them. Mussaurus are very small for sauropodomorphs, and are relatively easy herbivores to take care of. All they need is lush vegetation, some trees, and water.
info.jurassicraft.procompsognathus.name=Procompsognathus triassicus is a small theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Triassic Period in Europe. Reaching only 0.6 meters tall, Procompies are primarily dangerous due to the large packs that they roam in. They also possess a mildly soporific (inducing drowsiness or sleep) bite. So while they may not be all that dangerous alone, they can pose quite a threat as a group.
info.jurassicraft.spinosaurus.name=Spinosaurus aegyptiacus was a massive theropod that existed in what is now North Africa during the Cretaceous period. Spinosaurus is the largest of all known carnivorous dinosaurs, even larger than the Tyrannosaurus. Its most distinctive feature was the huge sail-like fin on its back, and was made from spines that came out of the top of its backbones. Both a carnivore and piscivore, Spinosaurus is highly dangerous on land and sea. Be extremely careful when cloning this animal.
info.jurassicraft.stegosaurus.name=Stegosaurus stenops lived in Late Jurassic North America. A truly gargantuan creature, Stegosaurus could reach up to 6 meters tall and 10 meters long. The plates on its back may have been for display, thermoregulation, or both. The spikes on the end of its tail are called thagomizers. Stegosauruses are docile creatures unless provoked, quick to defend themselves or their young. Efficient in cycad ingestion, their digestive systems produce natural antidotes to cycad toxins.
info.jurassicraft.segisaurus.name=Segisaurus halli was a small coelophysid from North America in the Early Jurassic. Reaching up to 1 meter tall, this animal has been hypothesized to be able to reach incredible speeds due to its aerodynamic anatomy. Like its close relative Procompsognathus, Segisaurus possessed a venomous bite. But unlike the soporific bite of the Procompy, the venom that Segisaurus produces slows down its prey upon being bitten.
info.jurassicraft.ceratosaurus.name=Ceratosaurus nasicornis was a medium sized theropod from Late Jurassic North America. A little over 3 meters tall fully grown, it was a uniquely identifiable creature due to both its prominent nasal horns and its neck-to-tail osteoderms. Though stockily built and large in size, Ceratosaurus shared its habitat with even larger theropods like Torvosaurus and Allosaurus, likely indicating that they occupied separate ecological niches.
info.jurassicraft.corythosaurus.name=Corythosaurus casuarius was a large hadrosaur from the Upper Cretaceous in what is now modern North America. Reaching 3 meters tall fully grown, it was a truly magnificent and striking animal. The beautiful calls made by the Corythosaurus are from air being pushed through its hollow crest. Despite being quite hefty in size, Corythosaurus is an exceptionally timid creature, and will run away from nearly anything. All of these things considered, Corythosaurus is a calming presence in any park.
info.jurassicraft.herrerasaurus.name=Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis is one of the earliest known dinosaurs, originating from Late Triassic South America. A theropod of medium size, it stood at almost exactly 2 meters as an adult. A stout and powerfully built carnivore, Herrerasaurus has the unique ability to digest bone, allowing it to swallow huge chunks of meat whole. They usually roam in small to medium sized packs. That and their willingness to pursue prey over long distances makes them a dangerous animal to any prospective park builder.
info.jurassicraft.proceratosaurus.name=Proceratosaurus bradleyi was a genus of small sized theropod from the Middle Jurassic of England. About 1.4 meters tall fully grown, Proceratosaurus was originally thought to be an ancestor of Ceratosaurus, due to the similar small crest on its snout. Now however, it is considered a coelurosaur. Specifically, one of the earliest known members of Tyrannosauroidea. A small pack hunter, they can often be found amongst tight-knit groups.
info.jurassicraft.pachycephalosaurus.name=Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis was a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur that originated from Late Cretaceous North America. Around 2.1 meters tall fully grown, it is the largest pachycephalosaurid known. It has a domed head and bony bumps at the back of its head and down its snout, the former of which it uses to attack. Pachycephalosauruses roam in groups of between three and six individuals, and are usually best to stay a safe distance away from, on account of its short temper.
info.jurassicraft.metriacanthosaurus.name=Metriacanthosaurus parkeri was a genus of metriacanthosaurid  dinosaur from the upper Oxford Clay of England, dating to the Late Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. It is a medium sized theropod with a femur length of 80 cm. It is estimated to have weighed 1 tonne. This creature was named for the height of its neural spine, which surprisingly is fairly standard size for a theropod.
info.jurassicraft.allosaurus.name=Allosaurus fragilis was the most common predator of the Late Jurassic period and among the most dangerous. Like most theropod dinosaurs, its jaws were filled with serrated teeth shaped like blades. Computer studies suggest that Allosaurus attacked by using its upper jaw like a machete to hack at its victim, then it used its lower jaw to bite out a slice of meat.
info.jurassicraft.huayangosaurus.name=Huayangosaurus taibaii is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaur that originated from Middle Jurassic Asia. A small species of stegosaur, Huayangosaurus is more easily contained than its relatives. Like many other stegosaurians, it had plates all down its back and spikes on its tail. Two large spikes were above its hips, and may have been used for deterring an attack from above. Huayangosaurus is sometimes placed within its own taxonomic family, Huayangosauridae, though this group has no formal definition or other content.
info.jurassicraft.baryonyx.name=Baryonyx walkeri was a 2.5 to 3 meter tall spinosaurian dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous period, about 130-125 million years ago. Baryonyx means "heavy claw", it alludes to the animal's very large claw on the first finger, it could reach to 30cm! The specific name "walkeri" refers to its discoverer William J. Walker. The holotype specimen is one of the most complete theropod skeletons from the UK. This animal is a highly aggressive spinosaur.
info.jurassicraft.apatosaurus.name=Apatosaurus ajax is one of the most famous of the giant Jurassic herbivorous dinosaurs. This long-necked sauropod is a fairly typical member of the diplodocid family - long neck, pillar-like legs, long tapering tail and enormous size. In order to facilitate the processing of food, which it can't chew with its teeth. Apatosaurus swallows stones that it keeps in a gizzard similar to that found in a chicken. Apatosaurus reaches its full size in 10 years.
info.jurassicraft.leaellynasaura.name=Leaellynasaura amicagraphica is a genus of small herbivorous ornithischian dated to between 118 and 110 million years ago. Leaellynasaura is a relatively small dinosaur, about 90 centimeters (3 feet) in length. Leaellynasaura has been variously described as a hypsilophodontid, a primitive iguanodontian or a primitive ornithischian. A 2019 study recovered it as a member of Elasmaria. Leaellynasaura was an Australian polar dinosaur. At this period in time, Victoria would have been within the Antarctic Circle.
info.jurassicraft.compsognathus.name=Compsognathus longipes, often referred to simply as "compy", was a 0.3 to 0.4 meter tall coelurosaurian dinosaur from the Late Jurassic. It was first discovered in Germany. Compsognathuses typically hunt small lizards and insects, but like other opportunistic theropods, will scavenge larger animal carcasses when available. They stay in large packs, sometimes up to 25 individuals. However, unlike the Procompsognathus, they are not poisonous.
info.jurassicraft.ornitholestes.name=Ornitholestes hermanni was the first theropod to be discovered in the 1900s. Ornitholestes (meaning "bird robber"), represents a partial skeleton with skull, including numerous elements of the vertebral column, the forelimbs, pelvis and hindlimbs. The front teeth of Ornitholestes were somewhat conical, with reduced serrations; the back teeth were recurved and more sharply serrated, similar to those of other theropod dinosaurs.
info.jurassicraft.hadrosaurus.name=Hadrosaueus foulkii is genus of hadrosaurid dinosaur that lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous Period about 80 - 78 MYA. Hadrosaurus foulkii means "bulky lizard", and the species was named "foulkii" after William Parker Foulke who first sighted the fossil of this wonderful creature. Some Hadrosaurus specimens, as well as other hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus and Brachylophosaurus have shown evidence of tumors including hemangiomas, metastatic cancer, desmoplastic fibroma, and osteoblastoma.
info.jurassicraft.carnotaurus.name=Carnotaurus sastrei was a lightly built, bipedal predator, measuring 7.5 to 9 m (24.6 to 29.5 ft) in length and weighing at least 1.35 metric tons (1.33 long tons; 1.49 short tons). As a theropod, Carnotaurus was highly specialized and distinctive. It had thick horns above the eyes, a feature unseen in all other carnivorous dinosaurs, and a very deep skull sitting on a muscular neck. The only skeleton (holotype MACN-CH 894) was unearthed in 1984 by an expedition led by Argentinian paleontologist José Bonaparte.
info.jurassicraft.homalocephale.name=Homalocephale calathocercos was about 1.8 m long. Unlike other definitely adult pachycephalosaurs, Homalocephale sported a flat, wedge-shaped skull roof. Nonetheless, the surface of the skull was fairly thickened. It was described from an incomplete skull and postcranial material (holotype MPC-D 100/1201) from the Nemegt locality of the Nemegt Formation. The specimen has large openings on the top of the skull, a distinct frontoparietal suture, low and long infratemporal fenestrae, and a large, round eye socket.
info.jurassicraft.suchomimus.name=Suchomimus tenerensis's narrow skull was perched on a short neck, and its forelimbs were powerfully built, bearing a giant claw on each thumb. Suchomimusis is potentially a junior synonym of another spinosaurid from the Elrhaz Formation, Cristatusaurus lapparenti, named the same year based on jaw fragments and vertebrae. Unlike most giant theropod dinosaurs, Suchomimus had a very crocodilian-like skull, with a long, low snout and narrow jaws. It was exhibited in Jurassic World in the Cretaceous Cruise.
info.jurassicraft.troodon.name=Troodon pectinodon is a night crawling dinosaur, its venomous bite weakens Troodon's preys so that it can eat them while unconscious. These creatures were the most intelligent among all dinosaurs being capable of creating plans for hunting and killing off big preys. Troodon's eyes are very sensitive to light, hence their nocturnal habits.
info.jurassicraft.machairasaurus.name=Machairasaurus leptonychus is a genus of oviraptorid dinosaur which was found in the Bayan Mandahu Formation, China, dating to the late Cretaceous period. During the Sino-Canadian expeditions of 1988 and 1990 some skeletons of unknown oviraptorosaurians were discovered by Philip J. Currie in Inner Mongolia. Based on two of these a new genus was named and described by Nicholas R. Longrich, Currie and Dong Zhiming in 2010 with as type species Machairasaurus leptonychus.
info.jurassicraft.titanis.name=Titanis walleri was approximately 1.4 to 1.9 meters (4.6 to 6.2 ft) tall and around 150 kilograms (330 lb) in weight. It was thought to be carnivorous and most likely preyed on the many small mammals of the time period. It was a giant flightless terror bird that inhabited North America during the early Pliocene to early Pleistocene epochs. The wings were small and couldn't have been used for flight. The wing bones articulated in an unusual joint-like structure, suggesting the digits could flex to some degree.
info.jurassicraft.hypsilophodon.name=Hypsilophodon foxii's first specimen was recovered in 1849, when workers dug up the soon-called Mantell-Bowerbank block from an outcrop of the Wessex Formation, about one hundred yards west of Cowleaze Chine, on the south-west coast of Isle of Wight. Immediate reception to Huxley's proposal of a new genus, distinct from Iguanodon, was mixed. The issue of distinctiveness was seen as important as more information on the form of Iguanodon was in demand, and the cranial anatomy in particular was of importance.
info.jurassicraft.ornithomimus.name=Ornithomimus velox is a genus of ornithomimid dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous Period of what is now North America. It is usually classified into two species: the type species, Ornithomimus velox, and a referred species, Ornithomimus edmontonicus. At first it had been common to name each newly discovered ornithomimid as a species of Ornithomimus. Ornithomimus was a swift bipedal theropod which fossil evidence indicates was covered in feathers, equipped with a small toothless beak that may indicate an omnivorous diet.
info.jurassicraft.coelophysis.name=Coelophysis bauri was a small, slightly-build dinosaur that walked on two long legs. This predator was about 9 feet long (2.8m). It had light, hollow bones, hence its name, a long pointed head with dozens of small, serrated teeth, three clawed fingers on its hands and a long neck. Named in 1887, the type species of Coelophysis was originally named as a species of Coelurus. Paul (1988) estimated the weight of the gracile form at 15 kg (33 lb), and the weight of the robust form at 20 kg (44 lb).
info.jurassicraft.monolophosaurus.name=Monolophosaurus jiangi (meaning "single-crested lizard"), and the specific name refers to Jiangjunmiao, an abandoned desert inn near which the fossil was found. Jiangjunmiao means "the temple (miao) of the general (jiangjun)"; local legend has it that a general was buried here. is an extinct genus of tetanuran theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic Shishugou Formation in what is now Xinjiang, China. The holotype IVPP 84019 was discovered in the Junggar Basin, in layers of the Wucaiwan Formation dating from the Bathonian-Callovian. 
info.jurassicraft.megapiranha.name=Megapiranha paranensis is an extinct serrasalmid characin fish from the Late Miocene (8–10 million years ago) Ituzaingó Formation of Argentina, described in 2009. This river meat-eating monster-fish hunts in packs eating everything under 10 feet long. It is thought to have been about 71 centimetres (28 in) in length and 10 kilograms (22 lb) in weight. The holotype consists only of premaxillae and a zigzag tooth row; the rest of its body is unknown. It was one of the species introduced in the Netflix series "Camp Cretaceous".
info.jurassicraft.chilesaurus.name=Chilesaurus diegosuarezi is an extinct genus of herbivorous dinosaur.  Chilesaurus lived about 145 million years ago in the Late Jurassic period of Chile. It measured roughly 3.2 m (10.5 ft) from nose to tail. The holotype is a smaller individual of half that length. The most unusual feature of this genus is its spatula-shaped, elongated teeth, obliquely pointing forwards. Such dentition would be unique in Theropoda, where it has sometimes been recovered, and is typical for a herbivore indicating that it was a plant-eater.
info.jurassicraft.styracosaurus.name=Native to Canada, Styracosaurus albertensis is one of the most beautiful ceratopsians we have ever created, it measures 20ft in length and weighs around 3tons. This social creature displays a beautiful set of 6 huge spikes on its frill and has a huge nasal horn. Unlike its ceratopsian cousins, Styracosaurus lacks of eye horns.
info.jurassicraft.mixosaurus.name=Mixosaurus cornalianus is a genus of small mixosauridae marine reptile, native to Italy and Switzerland, being one of the most beautiful ichthyosaurs out there. This creature's fossils have been discovered in many places around Europe. This creature is a very social reptile and doesn't like loneliness. Mixosaurus panxianensis was discovered in the Middle Triassic of the Guizhou Province, China.
info.jurassicraft.leedsichthys.name=Leedsichthys problematicus is the biggest fish ever discovered reaching twice the size of a scholar bus. During the 1880s, the gentleman farmer Alfred Nicholson Leeds collected large fish fossils from loam pits near Peterborough, England. In May 1886 these were inspected by John Whitaker Hulke, who in 1887 partially reported them as the back plates of the stegosaurian Omosaurus.
info.jurassicraft.edmontosaurus.name=Edmontosaurus annectens (/ɛdˌmɒntəˈsɔːrəs/ ed-MON-tə-SOR-əs) (meaning "lizard from Edmonton") is a genus of hadrosaurid dinosaur. It has three junior synonyms, Anatosaurus, Anatotitan, and Ugrunaaluk. Edmontosaurus was created by InGen for Masrani Global Corporation's new dinosaur park Jurassic World. The Edmontosaurus clones on the website oddly didn't have the fleshy comb on their heads like one of the original species.
info.jurassicraft.microceratus.name=Microceratus gobiensis is a genus of small ceratopsian dinosaur that lived 90 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. The type species is Microceratops gobiensis. However, the generic name was already preoccupied by an ichneumon wasp (subfamily Cryptinae) with the same name, so it was reassigned to Microceratus gobiensis. A second species was described as Microceratus sulcidens, but it was later discovered to be Asiaceratops.
info.jurassicraft.giganotosaurus.name=Giganotosaurus carolinii is a species of theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now Argentina, during the early Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 99.6 to 95 million years ago. The holotype specimen was discovered in the Candeleros Formation of Patagonia in 1993 and is almost 70% complete. Part of the family Carcharodontosauridae, Giganotosaurus is one of the most completely known members of the group, which includes other large theropods, such as the closely related Carcharodontosaurus.
info.jurassicraft.lesothosaurus.name=Lesothosaurus diagnosticus was a 2 metres (6.6 ft) long, bipedal omnivore. It was one of the earliest ornithischians. Its long slender legs, small arms with hands that would not have been able to grasp properly, and slender tail all suggest that it was a fast runner. The small skull of Lesothosaurus was short and flat, with large eye sockets. Discoveries of Lesothosaurus in the Upper Elliot Formation suggest that this early ornithischian dinosaur may have lived in groups. t was named by paleontologist Peter Galton in 1978.
info.jurassicraft.mosasaurus.name=Mosasaurus hoffmanni is a genus of mosasaur, carnivorous, aquatic lizards, somewhat resempling flippered crocodiles, with enlongated heavy jaws. It lived from about 82 to 66 million years ago during the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous in the area of modern western Europe and North America. Traditional interpretations have estimated the maximum length of the largest species, M. hoffmannii, to be up to 17.1 meters (56 ft), making it one of the largest mosasaurs.
info.jurassicraft.protoceratops.name=Protoceratops andrewsi was a quadrupedal dinosaur that was partially characterized by its distinctive neck frill at the back of its skull. The frill itself contained two large pariental fenestra (holes in the frill), while its cheeks had large jugal bones. It is a fairly common fossil, being one of the few dinosaurs that's complete growth history can be seen in fossils. Protoceratops were hunted by Velociraptor, and one particularly famous specimen (the Fighting Dinosaurs) preserves a pair of them locked in combat.
info.jurassicraft.xiphactinus.name=Xiphactinus audax, like many other species in the Late Cretaceous oceans, a dead or injured individual was likely to be scavenged by sharks (Cretoxyrhina and Squalicorax). The remains of a Xiphactinus were found within a large specimen of Cretoxyrhina collected by Charles H. Sternberg. The specimen is on display at the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. Virtually nothing is known about the larval or juvenile stages. When alive, the fish would have resembled a gargantuan, fanged tarpon.
info.jurassicraft.rhizodus.name=Rhizodus serpukhovensis Rhizodus (root tooth) is an extinct genus of basal, finned tetrapodomorphs (the group of sarcopterygians that contains modern tetrapods and their extinct relatives). It belonged to Rhizodontida, one of the earliest-diverging tetrapodomorph clades. Two valid species have been described, both of which lived during the Early Carboniferous epoch. The most notable characteristics of Rhizodus were the two 22 centimetres fangs located near the front of its jaws, followed by other teeth scaling downwards in size.
info.jurassicraft.tylosaurus.name=Tylosaurus proriger had a large, strong chest and arms, a long body, and a strong tail for swimming. It has a ram-shaped snouth and big conical teeth for catching prey. It  is a mosasaur, or Meuse River lizard. Its food was turtles, plesiosaurs, other mosasaurs, large fish and shellfis. A distinguishing characteristic of Tylosaurus is the elongated conical rostrum that protrudes from its snout, from which the genus is named. Fossil evidence of the skin of Tylosaurus in the form of scales has been described since the late 1870s.
info.jurassicraft.kaprosuchus.name=Kaprosuchus saharicus is an extinct species of mahajangasuchid crocodyliform. It is known from a single nearly complete skull collected from the Upper Cretaceous Echkar Formation of Niger. The name means "boar crocodile" from the Greek κάπρος, kapros ("boar") and σοῦχος, soukhos ("crocodile") in reference to its unusually large caniniform teeth which resemble those of a boar. Kaprosuchus is known from a nearly complete skull 507 mm in length in which the lower jaw measured 603 mm long.
info.jurassicraft.pteranodon.name=Pteranodon longiceps Nonetheless, Pteranodon is the most famous pterosaur, frequently featured in dinosaur media and strongly associated with dinosaurs by the general public. While not dinosaurs, pterosaurs such as Pteranodon form a clade closely related to dinosaurs as both fall within the clade Avemetatarsalia. Pteranodon was the first pterosaur found outside of Europe. Its fossils first were found by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1871, in the Late Cretaceous Smoky Hill Chalk deposits of western Kansas.
info.jurassicraft.ankylosaurus.name=Ankylosaurus magniventris' fossils have been found in geological formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous Period, about 68–66 million years ago, in western North America, making it among the last of the non-avian dinosaurs. It was named by Barnum Brown in 1908; it is monotypic, containing only A. magniventris. The generic name means "fused lizard", and the specific name means "great belly". Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus.
info.jurassicraft.alvarezsaurus.name=Alvarezsaurus calvoi was a bipedal theropod that, like other lightweight theropods, had a long tail, and its leg structure suggests that it was a fast runner. Alvarezsaurus is considered basal to better-known members of its family, such as Mononykus and Shuvuuia. It has been alternately classified with both non-avian theropod dinosaurs and early birds, but a move of the alvarezsaurids to be recognized as more closely related to neornithine birds proved controversial despite being supported by earlier studies.
info.jurassicraft.oviraptor.name=Oviraptor were named by Henry Fairfield Osborn. The genus name refers to the initial thought of egg-stealing habits, and the specific name was intended to reinforce this view indicating a preference over ceratopsian eggs. The initial relationships of Oviraptor were poorly understood at the time and was assigned to the unrelated Ornithomimidae by the original describer, Henry Osborn. However, re-examinations made by Rinchen Barsbold proved that Oviraptor was distinct enough to warrant a separate family, the Oviraptoridae.
info.jurassicraft.achillobator.name=Achillobator giganticus is a species of large dromaeosaurid dinosaur that lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous period about 96 million to 89 million years ago in what is now the Bayan Shireh Formation. It was a large, heavy-built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore that would have been an active feathered predator hunting with the enlarged sickle claw on each second toe. Achillobator was a deep-bodied and relatively short-armed dromaeosaurid with stocky and robust hindlimbs.
info.jurassicraft.guanlong.name=Guanlong wucaii Guanlong was discovered in the Dzungaria area of China by a joint expedition by scientists from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology and George Washington University, and named by Xu Xing and others in 2006. Guanlong comes from the Chinese words for "crown" and "dragon", referring to the crest. The specific epithet, wucaii (Hanyu Pinyin: wǔcǎi), means "multicoloured" and refers to the colours of rock of the Wucaiwan ("multicolored bay"), the multi-hued badlands where the creature was found.
info.jurassicraft.ludodactylus.name=Ludodactylus sibbicki is a species of anhanguerid pterodactyloid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous period (Aptian stage) of what is now the Crato Formation of the Araripe Basin in Ceará, Brazil. The generic name Ludodactylus refers to the fact that the animal had the combination of teeth and a Pteranodon-like head crest. No such creature was known to exist until the discovery of Ludodactylus. However, it is not the only pterosaur known to possess these features, its very close relative Caulkicephalus is another example.
info.jurassicraft.leptictidium.name=Leptictidium auderiense (a Latinized diminutive of the name of its relative Leptictis, which means "graceful weasel" in Ancient Greek) is an extinct genus of small mammals that were likely bipedal. Comprising eight species, they resembled today's bilbies, bandicoots, and elephant shrews. Together with macropods, giant pangolins, and humans, it is the only known completely bipedal mammal. They are especially interesting for their combination of characteristics of primitive eutherians.
info.jurassicraft.dunkleosteus.name=Dunkleosteus terrelli, is an extinct genus of large armored, jawed fishes that existed during the Late Devonian period, about 382–358 million years ago. Numerous fossils of the various species have been found in North America, Poland, Belgium, and Morocco. Dunkleosteus was named in 1956 to honour David Dunkle (1911–1982), former curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Originally thought to be a member of the genus Dinichthys, it was later recognized as belonging to its own genus in 1956.
info.jurassicraft.alligator_gar.name=Atractosteus spatula, most commonly known as alligator gar, is a ray-finned euryhaline fish related to the bowfin in the infraclass Holostei. It is the largest species in the gar family, and among the largest freshwater fish in North America. Gars are often referred to as "primitive fishes", or "living fossils" because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors, such as a spiral valve intestine, which is also common to the digestive system of sharks, and the ability to breathe both air and water.
info.jurassicraft.dodo.name=Raphus cucullatus is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, which is east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo's closest genetic relative was the also-extinct Rodrigues solitaire. The two formed the subfamily Raphinae, a clade of extinct flightless birds that were a part of the family which includes pigeons and doves. The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. Subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) tall and may have weighed 10.6–17.5 kg (23–39 lb) in the wild.
info.jurassicraft.ichthyosaurus.name=Ichthyosaurus breviceps was smaller than most of its relatives, with the largest specimen of I. somersetensis measuring up to 9.8–10.8 ft in length and (490 lb) in body mass. Icthyosaurus is distinguished from other ichthyosaurs by having a wide forefin with 5 or more digits with an anterior digital bifurcation, but the morphology of the humerus and coracoids are also distinct from that of other Lower Jurassic ichthyosaurs, as is the arrangement of the dermal bones.
